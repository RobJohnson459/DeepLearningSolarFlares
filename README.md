--- Rob Johnson, Christine Huffman, Rouselene Larson ---

This is the repository for the term project of the authors for the Deep Learning Theory class of Spring 2020. 
The data referenced can be found at https://dmlab.cs.gsu.edu/solar/data/data-comp-2020/


This project falls into four sections:

* K means
* CNN
* RNN
* two linear models stacked in a trench coat



-- KNN --

This is the standard lazy model - find the K nearest neighbors, and have them vote on which class the input is.

-- CNN --

A convolutional neural network with a 1*n kernel for each convolutional layer. 

-- RNN --

TBD: we still need to learn about these ones first before we are comfortable offering a theoretical background for this.

-- two linear models stacked in a trench coat --

While the title yields a descriptive image, this is really 35 input linear model layers that output one number, which is then placed in a vector and another linear model placed to make a prediction on this vector.
